          The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the
          eastern edge of Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by
          area one of the world's largest art museums. The first portion of the
          approximately 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) building was built in
          1880. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park
          in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art,
          architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.
